# In this section we will explode the power of graphs by using some of the suggested algorithms in Neo4j.
# 
# ## Creating the connector
# As in previous parts, let's first create the connector to handle the messages with Neo4j.

# In[1]:


from connector import Neo4jConnector
from getpass import getpass

uri = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
user = "neo4j"
password = getpass("Input your password to connect")
conn = Neo4jConnector(uri, user, password)


# ## Triggering algorithms from the graph-data-science library
# 
# The graph data science library helps us execute common graph algorithms with Neo4j. This can be useful to analyze our graphs from this point of view, more like a graph rather than a database, providing useful information.
# 
# ### Betweeness algorithm
# 
# This is a very interesting algorithm that provides information about the "bridges" on a particular graph. This means, it will return nodes that have key connections in the graph, connection different regions accross it.

# In this case, we are analysing the similarity between two "Paper" nodes over the edge "RELATED_TO".
